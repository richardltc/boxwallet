# What is BoxWallet? #

BoxWallet is a single binary multi-coin CLI tool, that gets your coin-of-choice wallet/node set-up ***fast*** with just a few commands:

`./boxwallet coin` - allows you to choose your coin of choice, which then downloads the projects core files from their official website and installs them automatically.

`./boxwallet start` - starts the coin's daemon, which syncs the Blockchain.

`./boxwallet dash` - displays a dashboard with the coins Blockchain and wallet info.

## What are some of BoxWallet's features? ##

* Install and run a CLI node or wallet simply, by using two commands: `coin`, to choose your coin and `start` to start the syncing.
* Easily keep up-to-date with the latest version of BoxWallet by using the separate `bwupdater` app.
* Setting up multiple nodes/staking wallets on a single machine, and easily switch between them using the `coin` command.
* Viewing your wallet/node that might be running on a Raspberry Pi, from another computer such as Linux, Mac or Windows.
* Displaying the staking status of your wallet. 
* Displaying blockchain and master node syncing status.
* Displaying of block count and network difficulty.
* Displaying of % coins required for staking. (for DIVI)
* Auto fixing common wallet issues, which can be common after power failures.
* Balance in your coin, USD, AUD and GBP (more coming soon...)

## How can I install BoxWallet?

### Windows

Download the file `boxwallet_XXX_Windows_64bit.zip` where `XXX` represents the latest version number.
Extract the files, open a command prompt, then run `boxwallet coin`

### Linux

I'm going to assume that you've got a basic CLI Linux installation, and have SSH access.

Go to the page: `https://github.com/richardltc/boxwallet/releases/latest` and find the correct Linux file for your platform.
If you are running normal Linux, you'll almost certainly want the file ending in `Linux_64bit.tar.gz`
However, if you're running on a Raspberry Pi, you'll probably want the file ending in `Linux_arm32bit.tar.gz` unless you're running a 64bit OS, in which case, you'll need the file ending in `Linux_arm64.tar.gz
`


In your browser, right click on the correct file you need and choose "copy link", then, in your Linux terminal, type `wget ` then paste the link after it.

If the version of BoxWallet was `0.41.1` you should now have a line of text that looks like the following:

`wget https://github.com/richardltc/boxwallet/releases/download/0.41.1/boxwallet_0.41.1_Linux_64bit.tar.gz`

Press return, and the command `wget` should now download that file to you current directory.

Next, enter the command:

`tar -xf ./boxwallet` then, without a space, press the tab key to auto-complete the command line.
You should then have a line that says:

`tar -xf ./boxwallet_0.41.1_Linux_64bit.tar.gz`

Press return, and you should then have the following files:

`boxwallet` - The BoxWallet application.

`bwupdater` - The tool that you can run, to keep BoxWallet up-to-date.

`README.md` - This file.

### How do I run? ###

Download BoxWallet, for your platform of choice, from the releases page, extract the files to a location of your choosing and then run `./boxwallet coin`.
 
This will download the official binaries from the coin's project website, and install them automatically for you.

Then run `./boxwallet start`, to start the coin's daemon server. 

Then  `./boxwallet dash`, where you will be greeted with an initial wizard to get you going, followed by a dashboard.

### OK, but what else can BoxWallet do? ###

* Creates an initial wallet from scratch, for the coin of your choosing.

* Takes you through an initial wizard to ensure your wallet is secure.

* `boxwallet coin` - Installs the official coin project CLI files, and creates a new wallet.

* `boxwallet dash` - Displays blockchain, syncing, staking and coin balance and AUD/USD/GBP (Divi only) balance info.

* `boxwallet send` - Send your crypto.

* `boxwallet wallet backup` - Creates a backup of your `wallet.dat` file, and names it based on the days date.

* `boxwallet wallet encrypt/unlock/unlockfs` - Allows the encryption and unlocking of the wallet for safe staking.

* `boxwallet wallet displayaddress` - Displays your public coin address.

* `boxwallet wallet reindex` - re-indexes your local copy of the Blockchain

* `boxwallet wallet resync` - Performs a complete, from scratch, resync of the Blockchain.


* Allows you to "web enable" your existing wallet.

## How do I setup a client/server environment?

There may be times when you have your coin server running on one machine (machine A), and you want to run BoxWallet on another machine (machine B). This is how you would achieve that.

### Configure machine A (The coin daemon server)

On the machine running the coin daemon server, edit the coin's conf file e.g. `divi.conf`, that's stored in the hidden folder `~/.divi/` and make sure it contains the following settings, which are explained below:

```
rpcuser=divirpc
rpcpassword=A_Random_Password

server=1
rpcallowip=192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0
rpcport=51473

```
The `server=1` tells `divid` to listen for requests from BoxWallet.

The `rpcallowip=192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0` line, tells the `divid` server what IP addresses to *allow* a connection from. So, in our example, any local ipaddress in the range of 192.168.1.1-254 would be able to connect to the `divid` server.

Finally, the `rpcport=51473` tells the `divid` server what port to listen on. e.g. `51473`

After the settings have been implemented, you'll need to restart your `divid` server which can be achieved by `./boxwallet stop` and then `./boxwallet start`.

### Configure machine B (The BoxWallet client)

Download the latest version of BoxWallet from the website, or just copy the files from an existing installation.

Edit the `conf.json` config file, and make sure the following settings exist:
```
port: "51473"
rpcpassword: A_Random_Password
rpcuser: divirpc
serverip: 127.0.0.1

```

Make sure the `port`,`rpcuser` and `rpcpassword` are all the same as what it is in your `divi.conf` file on the server, and make sure the `serverip:` address, is set the same as the ipaddress as the server (machine A). In the above example, the `serverip: 127.0.0.1` would only work if BoxWallet was running on the *same* server as `divid`.

## Is it free? ##

Yes! BoxWallet is FREE to use, however, if you'd like to send a tip, please feel free:
